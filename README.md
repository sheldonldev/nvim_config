# nvim_config

-   If you just want to use vim without any plugin, the only thing need to do is:

```bash
cd ~ && curl -fLo ".vimrc" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheldonldev/nvim_config/main/.vimrc
```

-   If you want to use neovim with awesome plugins, read the followings.

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

-   Install [NodeJS & npm](https://nodejs.org);
-   Install [nerd-font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation");
-   Install [the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher);

### Install Neovim and Plugin Manager

-   Install [Neovim](https://neovim.io), then run `:checkhealth` to checkout more todos;
-   Install [vim-plugin](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug);

### Clone This Repo As Config

```bash
# remove the old ~/.config/nvim/ folder at first

# then clone this repo as ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/
git clone git@github.com:sheldonldev/nvim_config.git nvim

# create symbolic links
ln -s ~/.config/nvim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

-   Adjust the integrated terminal settings in `init.vim`:

```bash
# find the following lines and change settings adapt to your own shell

" open terminal "
function! OpenTerminal()
    split term://zsh    "change this line, default is zsh"
    resize 5
endfunction
```

-   Read the `.vimrc` and `init.vim` to learn the keymaps. And use `:h _search_term_` to open the manual if have any question;

-   If you want to use lint, please run npm installation locally, for example:

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

-   You can copy the `.eslintrc.json` and `prettierrc.json` to your project root.

## More Dependencies and Configurations For More Languages

-   We use [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) as LSP. The Extentions installed can be seen in `init.vim`, the line with `g: coc_global_extensions`;
-   If have any question, just checkout in their github repositories.
-   What we've done can support many aspects for your coding. For more enhanced, followings are the references.

### C/C++

-   The C/C++ part referres to <https://ianding.io/2019/07/29/configure-coc-nvim-for-c-c++-development/>

-   Install `brew install ccls` for C/C++.

-   To set up a C/C++ project:

    -   generate `compile_commands.json` and put it to your project root. In macOS, you can use one of the following methods;
        1. Intercepting the system calls and extracting the arguments passed to the compiler by dynamic library injection (e.g. Bear, scan-build):
            - pros: works for hard-coded compiler path;
            - cons: macOS prohibits dynamic library injection for security reasons if the the program to be injected is system software (e.g. clang from Xcode).
        2. Using a compiler wrapper (e.g. scan-build):
            - pros: doesn’t violate security policies;
            - cons: the compiler path must not be hard-coded.
    -   place `.ccls` to your project root. It is a text file, in which each line is a command line argument passed to the compiler. Here is an example of .ccls:

        ```text
        -I
        ../include
        -I
        ../vendor/include
        -std=c++14
        -stdlib=libc++
        -fPIC
        ```

-   If ccls cannot find your system headers…

    -   If you are using macOS, then chances are ccls cannot find system headers and as a result reports a bunch of errors.
    -   This is because new macOS systems moves system headers into the macOS SDK directory and no longer places them in `/usr/include`. And the reason why ccls can find the system headers previously is that `/usr/include` is hard-coded into ccls during compilation.
    -   To solve this problem, you can manually adding the path of the system headers to `.ccls`. Here is how to get the path:

        -   Run `g++ -E -x c++ - -v < /dev/null` in your terminal and you’ll see a list of include paths that the compiler searches. They are between `#include <...> search starts here:` and End of search list..
        -   Now put them into your `.ccls` file as `-isystem` options (unlike `-I`, the errors and warnings in the header files found in `-isystem` paths are ignored by the syntax checker).
        -   After manually adding these system header paths, the `.ccls` file might look like this:

            ```text
            -isystem
            /usr/local/include
            -isystem
            /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include/c++/v1
            -isystem
            /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/10.0.1/include
            -isystem
            /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include
            -isystem
            /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include
            ```
